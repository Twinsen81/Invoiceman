/**
 * A base [ViewModel] class that implements the core MVI logic.
 * It accepts events from UI, processes them, and emits a UI state and/or UI effects.
 *
 * UI state is all the data that a UI layer (a fragment) needs to render itself properly.
 * US state survives configuration changes.
 *
 * UI effect is one time event that should be processed by the UI layer. This can be a message to the user
 * or a navigation request (open another fragment).
 *
 * @param UiState a class that represents a UI state
 * @param UiEffect a class that represents a UI effect
 * @param Event a class that represents an event from UI or some other source
 * @param ViewModelResult a class that represents an intermediate result of the events processing
 * @property startingEvent the event that is fired when the ViewModel is created
 * @property startingUiState the initial state of the UI that should be rendered when the ViewModel is created
